# Client-Server-Application-for-Encrypted-Message-Transmission

# Project Description

This project involves developing a Client-Server application for transmitting encrypted messages from the Client to the Server. The application supports two encryption methods: Caesar Cipher with keys generated using the Diffie-Hellman algorithm and Transposition Cipher. The Client encrypts a user-input message using one of these algorithms and sends the encrypted message to the Server. The Server displays the received encrypted message and then decrypts it, displaying the decrypted message in its console.
